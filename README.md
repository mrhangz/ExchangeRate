**Code Architecture**
- I choose MVVM because it's easy to start for 1 person. If the project team is bigger I'd go for Clean Swift because it has a better template to follow.

**Improvements**
- Add unit tests
- Find better way to update view (probably try Combine for the first time for this)
- Add favorites to show only selected currencies on the Standard tab
- Better loading and empty state
- Better UI :)
